Networked Spell Checker Lab

The purpose of this project is to create a program that provides multi-threading capabilities
that accepts connections from various clients without waiting for the previous client to
disconnect. The program can be executed without any arguments provided, in which case the
default dictionary file and port 8888 with be used to start the server. 

To use a custom port, simply enter a valid port number. To change the dictionary file to use,
specify the file to use. Both arguments can be passed to the program at the same time. Order
does not matter.
